      <h2>
        What is command line rendering/batch rendering and what are the
        benefits?
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Command line rendering runs blender in the background with no user
          interface. The result is a faster, much more stable rendering process.
          If you have a large complex scene, rendering without a user interface
          can prevent crashes.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your computer is powerful enough, it will also allow you to work on
          other Blender projects whilst rendering in the background (more stable
          than opening multiple instances)
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also do ‘batch rendering’ you can queue up multiple renders to
          run sequentially. This is great if you want to render overnight or
          when away from your computer. You can read up about Blender command
          line rendering here

      <h2>What is Blender Command Line Render Tool?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Input Target file</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is recommended that you move your blend file(s) you want to
              render to your desktop.
            </li>
            <li>
              To find you the file path, right click on the file, go to
              properties, navigate to the security tab and copy paste the object
              name. C:/ has been pre-populated (you can change if running off a
              different drive).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Input Blender download directory</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You need to input your Blender application file path. You can do
              this by navigating to where your blender application is located
              and looking under properties as per step 1.
            </li>
            <p>
              This is an example of where I downloaded a copy of Blender 3.1 to
              my desktop C:\Users\hallo\OneDrive\Desktop\Blender 3.1
              alpha\blender-3.1.0-alpha+master.1d9bac7d921f-windows.amd64-release\blender.exe
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tip:</strong> You can save the download directory as a
              preset.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Select your render engine</h3>
          <p>
            Eevee or Cycles – for Cycles you have the option to print stats –
            this will give additonal information in the command line e.g. the
            time taken to render (after the rendering has finished)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Render Type</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Selective animation</strong> - You can choose to render a
              frame range, select this option and enter the start and end frame
              you wish to render.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full animation</strong> – this will render the full
              animations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Single frame</strong> – type in the frame number you want
              to be rendered
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Generate new command</h3>

          <p>
            This will generate the script for you to copy paste into the command
            line (Command + V to paste). Press enter to run.
          </p>

          <h4>How do I access the command line?</h4>
          <p>
            You can open the command line by searching for ‘Powershell’ in the
            windows search bar.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How do I access the command line?</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have hit generate, simply change the variables above i.e.
            choose a new blender file or select different frame numbers, hit
            ‘add to batch’ and this will generate a new script with the
            additional tasks added.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure you set the output folder within the output properties tab
            of blender prior to rendering (where you want frames to be stored).
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you are happy with render settings in blender i.e.
            samples, resolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting the correct blender file path/directory is the most likely
            cause of issues. To simplify, you can re-download blender and save
            it to your desktop, or download a version from
            https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/archive/
          </li>
          <li>
            If the clear button doesn’t work, then try refreshing your browser
          </li>

          <li>
            The app defaults to C:/ If you have a different drive you want to
            run off (such as D:/ or Macbook then you can change this text.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you use steam to open blender it may be stored in an odd
            location, my steam blender file is stored in \Program Files
            (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blender\
          </li>
          <li>
            How do I know my render is running? – in the command line you should
            see text indicating the frame being rendered and how many samples
            have been processed. ‘Blender quit’ indicates the render is
            complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not close the Powershell window until it has completed rendering,
            closing will stop the render. If you want to render again/another
            project, then close and open a new power shell window.
          </li>
